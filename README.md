# **C# Projects**
#### These projects demonstrate some facets of my understanding of C#.

## [Car Insurance](https://github.com/jeremydelain/C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance) 

  This project is an MVC web application that simulates a rudimentary car insurance website. It takes users' input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

## [Blackjack](https://github.com/jeremydelain/C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

  This console application plays blackjack with you. I really enjoyed developing the class structure and counting logic in this game. There's a good deal of exception handling implemented, but I'm sure there's still plenty of ways to break it.
  
## [Vertigo Theatre](https://github.com/jeremydelain/C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/VertigoTheatre)

  This project is the most substantial thing I've produced while learning at The Tech Acedemy. I am very proud of the results and I honestly had a ton of fun learning about C#, the .Net Framework, and the structure of MVC based solutions. 
  
  I was a part of the team working on the "Production" section of the website, and I handled the CRUD for CastMember entities. 
  The create page is a simple form with a file selector for a profile picture.

  The selected image is turned into a byte array for storage.

  The Edit page looks almost the same and updates the CastMember entity when submitted.
  
  The Index page is organized by headers sorted by the "ProdutionTitle" property, representing the show cast members are working on. CastMembers are represented as Bootstrap cards in decks with each card displaying their profile picture and name. Clicking on the card brings you to their details, hovering displays the edit and delete buttons.

  The Index page includes a search/filter feature. Users can reload the page, filtering for a match in the CastMember's name or bio.

  The filtering occurs in the Controller, in the Index method.

  The delete icons brings you to a delete page to confirm before deleteing.
